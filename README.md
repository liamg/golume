# Golume

A tiny wrapper for addressing all pulse audio outputs at once, hacked together for nicer i3 key mappings when switching between laptop speakers/headphones.

sudo make install
```

## Usage

```
  --change-volume int
       Change the volume by a given percent (negative to decrease volume) on all outputs
  --toggle-mute
       Toggle mute on all outputs
```
